                    This is a program that generates truth tables.  Enter your formula in the top bar and hit compile.
                    The symbols are:
                    <pre>
                        ~    unary not
                        &    logical and
                        |    logical or
                        ->   implication
                        <->  equality
                        </pre>
                    It will only accept well-formed-formulas.

                    I'm having issues on Chrome that make it so you only see a grey box instead of the program if you open up the page more than once.
                    You can fix this by restarting your browser or by killing the java process.  If anyone knows why this happens, I'd be really interested in
                    finding out. Email me at ty@pre-alpha.com.
